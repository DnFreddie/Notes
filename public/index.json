This command must have a completion specification (compspec) defined using the complete builtin command. How It Works Identifying Command Name Empty String: If the command word is empty, a compspec defined with the -E option to complete is used. Full Pathname: If the command word is a full pathname, the system first searches for a compspec for the full pathname. Fallback: If no compspec is found, the system uses the -D option to complete for a default. If no default exists, alias expansion is attempted. Generating Matching Words Once a compspec is found, it is used to generate a list of matching words. If no compspec is found, default Bash completion occurs. Steps for Generating Matches Actions specified by compspec: Matches must be prefixed by the word being completed. Pathname Expansion with -G option: The FIGNORE variable filters matches. String argument with -W option: The string is split and expanded. Matches are then prefix-matched against the word being completed. Commands/Functions with -F and -C: These are invoked with certain environment variables (COMP_LINE, COMP_POINT, etc.) set. Filters, Prefixes, and Suffixes A filter specified with the -X option is applied to the list of generated matches. Prefix and suffix specified with -P and -S are added to each member of the completion list. Additional Options -o dirnames: Triggers directory name completion if no matches are generated. -o plusdirs: Adds directory name completions to the result. -o bashdefault: Tries Bash default completions if compspec generates no matches. -o default: Tries readline’s default completion if no matches are generated. Dynamic Completion Completion can be modified dynamically using shell functions. A function that returns an exit status of 124 triggers reevaluation of the compspec. Example for Dynamic Completion Here\u0026rsquo;s an example function for dynamically loading completions.\n_completion_loader() { . \u0026#34;/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh\u0026#34; \u0026gt;/dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; return 124 } complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default Bash Main ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/code_snippets/bash_copmplitons_man/","summary":"Overview Programmable completion in Bash is triggered when word completion is attempted for an argument to a certain command.

remember the feeling of your perfect setup.\nSpecial ordered coffee from Network Chuck.\nThe thrill of the customized Xmonad guessing your current mood and selecting the wallpaper accordingly.\nAll VSCode themes and plugins meticulously selected.\nThe urge to spout code like there\u0026rsquo;s no tomorrow.\nYou open your computer\nOnly to realize the disk is corrupted and all is gone\u0026hellip;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no turning back unless you have a photographic memory\nand even then, it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to redo this whole thing again.\nWhat if I tell you there\u0026rsquo;s a way to preserve your best system self?\nBuy my course at www\u0026hellip;\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m kidding, the recipe is simple.\n3 pillars of the stable system When you evaluate your environment, you have to focus on these 3 things:\n1.Backup Do I maintain backups regularly?\n2.Reproducibility How fast can I get it to work and deploy?\n3.Portability And how easy is it to get to it?\nRegular backups It\u0026rsquo;s the obvious one, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure there\u0026rsquo;s one thing you forgot to do so.\nThis one photo album from summer 2019? And that good you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t remember at all about it\u0026hellip;\nNo, I mean it.\nThe issue with backups is that they take a lot of mental effort to do so.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why you have to automate it.\nStick to the basic tools\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with git, you used rsync one or two times while SSHing to your Home Lab.\nYou might have heard about the cron jobs or systemd timers.\nWhy not combine all these tools?\nSo set up a repo backup or whatever\nremember about creating also one more branch not only main.\nThe thing is you might change something in config that\u0026rsquo;s not stable and later regret it.\nAnd I know in git, you can revert to the particular commit, but sometimes you like all the changes except one or two on different commits\u0026hellip;\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s say that main branch is for the stable version that you generally enjoy any future changes will be on dev.\nYou can always merge them any time.\nThen get the list of things you want to backup into one .txt file and use some bash example\nwhile read -r line; do rsync -av \u0026#34;$line\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$HOME/backup\u0026#34; done \u0026lt; backup_list.txt Scheduling Now you have to know a bit about the cron jobs or systemd timers.\nCron jobs may be easier, but I think that having a unit is more future-proof.\n-Unit in systemd is just an entity that systemd manages.\nRemember we create a user unit not a root one\nmkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/ vim ~/.config/systemd/user/backup.service vim ~/.config/systemd/user/backup.timer [Unit] Description=Backup files [Service] ExecStart=/bin/bash -c \u0026#39;path/to/your/script\u0026#39; [Install] WantedBy=network.target Install is just which step of the system initialization it should be executed with\n(remember not explicitly after or before).\nBecause systemd is the parent of all the processes.\nAnd it spawns them in a particular order.\nTry\nsystemctl list-units --type=target Now set the timer with the same name but with .timer\n[Unit] Description=Run backup service daily [Timer] OnCalendar=daily Persistent=true [Install] WantedBy=default.target now add your sevice and timer with\nsystemctl --user daemon-reload systemctl --user --now enable backup.timer systemctl --user --now start backup.timer And voila, we can forget about this once and for all.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in backing up automatically on USB, You can edit /etc/fstab to mount your USB in the given location on boot\nAnd just add the path to rsync destination in the script\nBut be careful and read more about fstab before you start experimenting.\nReproducibility It\u0026rsquo;s great to have everything in place, but how quickly can we get it to work?\nUnfortunately, the process is currently too slow.\nManually moving files and installing software is a painful experience.\nTherefore, we need to create a script that processes our dotfiles, creates symlinks from the main repository to the .config and various directories, and installs executables based on a list.\n(I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a tool to streamline this using Go.)\nDeclarative vs Imperative Approach\nWhen we install packages and configure systems traditionally, we often take an imperative approach, making modifications directly rather than strictly defining configurations.\nIn the declarative approach, we predesign the system and apply the configuration, allowing for easy rebuilding after modifications.\nIn traditional systems, reverting to previous versions is challenging due to dependencies hell.\nThast why here comes our sponsor Nixos\u0026hellip;\nNix: Your Way Out Sorry, I know, I know, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the tech coaching channel. But back to the point.\nNixos, a Linux distribution , offers a completely declarative approach.\nYou write one configuration file called flake, and it sets up everything.\nIt installs every program and meanges every config specified, utilizing a tool like Homenager.\nAdditionally, it regularly creates snapshots of the enitre system, facilitating easy rollback in case of breaking changes.\nNixos also containerizes programs, isolating dependencies for easy testing and deployment.\nMeaning it installs programs in a separate environment that doesn\u0026rsquo;t share dependencies.\nThis makes testing ridiculously easy since you can install any app, test it, and forget about it.\n(In the future, there will be more collaboration between NixOS and Docker.)\nYou can create a .nix script to locally run and deploy containers based on it.\nThe possibilities are endless.\nSee the template\nDrawbacks of Nix While powerful, Nix has limitations. Direct binary installations are not supported, and it has a steep learning curve (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that the Nix language is functional).\nHowever, you can get around these issues by using flakes and nix-id.\nFor frequent testers or users with multiple devices, it\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended.\nThings get corupted (Security Concerns) These days, there are a lot of attacks on software, and particularly recently we had an affair with Heartbleed 2.0\nThe vulnerability is a backdoor in the xz utils package.\nA widely used Linux utility for compressing and decompressing files\nThe backdoor allows attackers to compromise SSH logins and gain unauthorized access to affected systems.\nTo fix this on nix, we will just revert to the previous version of the system and wait for a patch.\nOn another system, if we do regularly take snapshots, we can also do this.\nBut what happens to our GitHub projects? Does the code need bacup mechanism outside of github ?\nI know you haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about it, have you? Neither have I. That\u0026rsquo;s why this will be the topic of my next blog post.\nPortability Despite backups and automation, accessibility remains crucial.\nCan we access our files on the fly from another computer or sytsem?\nUsually, when we have a snapshot or a configuration, we have to install the particular operating system.\nThis is time-consuming and sometimes isn\u0026rsquo;t even possible\n(for example, when you are using someone else\u0026rsquo;s computer or you have Windows installed) .\nVirutalization the queen of the flexabilty When it comes to quick and easy solutions, containers immediately comes to mind.\nThey offer a rapid and straightforward approach: install everything you need in the container, push it to Dockerhub, and Pccess it from anywhere you want.\nHigly encourage to have the container withh all of ur\u0026rsquo;e little tools\nYou can even build container-based solutions or troubleshoot issues on the target network.\nContainers are quick, simple, and resource-efficient. However, for our daily driver, we\u0026rsquo;re looking for something more versatile and robust\nJust use Vms This article can be summed up in just one line.\nEmbrace VMs, and you\u0026rsquo;re set. Why?\n-They are easy to backup; you just create snapshots regularly.\n-You can test things and revert to the previous state or copy them every way you want.\n-They are extremely portable; you can have the image on a USB drive and boot it on almost any computer.\n-Plus, VMware Pro is now free on Windows.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not using VMs, just stop reading here and install one\u0026hellip;\nVentoy: The Swiss Army Knife of USB Sticks Here in Poland, we were recently advised to have a backpack with essential items just in case something happens.\nThese essentials include canned food, fresh water, and toilet paper.\nHowever, no one mentioned the importance of having a USB stick.\nWhat if a power outage occurs?\nThere will be no time to download disk passwords or, more importantly, ISO files.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why you should know about Ventoy.\nYou probably use Rufus or Balena Etcher to flash your USB drive.\nBut what if I told you that you could have all your VM ISOs, files, and family photos on one pen drive?\nVentoy does that for you.\nGo read about it and be prepared for anything.\nYou might laugh at me, but how would you know that the computer you happen to find wasn\u0026rsquo;t compromised or doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the tools you need to survive? Or there could be network limitations.\nTo sum up So, next time you\u0026rsquo;re diving into the digital land, remember these simple rules:\nBack it up, make it reproducible, and keep it portable.\nThese steps can save you a world of headache when disaster strikes.\nSo, keep tinkering, keep exploring, and above all, keep your system running like a champ.\nBecause in a world of chaos, your tech setup should be the calm in the storm.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t break easy, preserve that best version of your system!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/posts/dont_break_easy_preserve_best_version_of_your_sytsem/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m sure you remember the feeling of your perfect setup.\nSpecial ordered coffee from Network Chuck.\nThe thrill of the customized Xmonad guessing your current mood and selecting the wallpaper accordingly.\nAll VSCode themes and plugins meticulously selected.\nThe urge to spout code like there\u0026rsquo;s no tomorrow.\nYou open your computer\nOnly to realize the disk is corrupted and all is gone\u0026hellip;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no turning back unless you have a photographic memory","title":"dont_break_easy_preserve_best_version_of_your_sytsem"},{"content":"--- date:: 02 04 2023 topic:: network-psychical type:: network+ Digital Subscriber Line\nIt is a technology that uses existing telephone lines to provide high-speed Internet access to homes and businesses.

By leveraging vector embeddings, semantic search can go beyond keyword matching and deliver based on the query’s semantic meaning. Question-answering applications\nby training an embedding model with pairs of questions and corresponding answers, we can create an application that would answer questions that have not been seen before. Image search\nvector embeddings are perfectly suited to serve as the basis for image retrieval tasks. There are multiple off-the-shelf models, such as CLIP, ResNet, and more. Different models handle different types of tasks like image similarity, object detection, and many more. Audio search\nby converting the audio into a set of activations (an audio spectrogram), we produce vector embeddings that can be used for audio similarity search. Recommender Systems\nwe can create embeddings out of structured data that correlate to different entities such as products, articles, etc. In most cases, you’d have to create your own embedding model since it would be specific to your particular application. Sometimes this can be combined with unstructured embedding methods when images or text descriptions are found. Anomaly detection\nWe can create embeddings for anomaly detection using large data sets of labeled sensor information that identify anomalous occurrences.

It allows you to witness the entire operating system disappear and then be reborn in a matter of seconds.\n(I strongly advise you to try this at home: sudo rm -rfv /)\nWhen I wrote my first prompt two years ago, I was thrilled. I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand much of it, spending hours copying the file because it didn\u0026rsquo;t use the path to the cloud drive. Nevertheless, I realized that the system was mine, and I alone determined what went in and what went out. As you can imagine, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t satisfied with the commands used in the Windows environment.\n(especially if they are unaware of tools like ShellCheck)\nWhen I wrote my first scripts, I didn\u0026rsquo;t care about encapsulating variables in double quotes; I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what * meant. However, a friend of mine suggested I explore virtual machines for experimentation. This proved to be an excellent choice, allowing me to recreate the system instantly without any fear. (To this day, even though I\u0026rsquo;m a devoted Linux user, VMware and Windows still have their advantages.)\nI spent countless hours reading about different distributions, associating them with various desktop environments, feeling the need to learn one after another, switching between them every couple of days. I also experimented with various disruptive changes, such as installing different package managers, relaunching VMs because I lost the plank layout, and casually messing up all my programs because of casual use of sudo apt autoremove. I felt frustrated because I wanted to encapsulate them all, but it seemingly wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible. Finally, after about two months of continuous exploration, I switched to Manjaro because I wanted to stay current and share the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m using Arch, by the way\u0026rdquo; badge.\nIt dawned on me that the desktop manager differed from the distribution itself. I delved deeply into tiling window managers and the art of automating tasks. I even started tinkering with desktop files because Qtile refused to run without the SSDM recognizing them. Reading and adjusting the Qtile config became my obsession, only to discover that after a minor change, it errored and moved to the default settings. Frustration led me to switch to i3.\nBut it wasn\u0026rsquo;t without a hassle. Once, I managed to unintentionally delete all the desktop sessions while attempting to use i3 with XFCE. It left me with no desktop environment and forced me into a full system format (a popular way to solve problems in the Linux world, fast and without excessive time consumption).\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t for nothing; format after format, I set up things faster and faster. I realized how regular backups are important and how the system operates. I became bolder, more daring, and that\u0026rsquo;s what ultimately inspired me to delve into serious programming.\nOne of my first apps that I built in Python was my interpretation of the flashcards app with Flask and a templating engine. I was quite proud of my little project and wasn\u0026rsquo;t really worried about safety. So, I gave the app to test to my friend in cybersecurity. He was clicking around when suddenly he copied the entire Bible and input it into the app, what\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that the app didn\u0026rsquo;t break , but you can imagine that it was not safe either. However, the most hilarious aspect of my work for my friend was that you could input HTML inside the flashcards and query the database that way (cross-site scripting). But let\u0026rsquo;s leave that behind in the past\u0026hellip;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to try messing up your system. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to tinker with your system. It grants you a deeper understanding of what lies beneath the surface. By making mistakes, you not only learn to avoid problems but also gain the ability to fix them in the future.\nI killed my system countless times, and yet it always came back.

You can't just learn Linux... But regardless of the surprise, you usually have a solid understanding of the system. You know more or less how things work, what\u0026rsquo;s required, and so on. That\u0026rsquo;s what I thought while studying for the CompTIA Linux+ certification.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure you have in mind Linux mantras \u0026ldquo;everything is a file\u0026rdquo; or that \u0026ldquo;you control the processes\u0026rdquo;, but little do you know\u0026hellip;\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s quite obvious that devices on your system are virtual files in a /dev directory, processes are files, even the request queue is a file. But what exactly does \u0026ldquo;file\u0026rdquo; mean? When you think about it, you probably imagine something similar to the request structures; it has some headers (type of the file, size, etc.), some metadata (permissions, and ownership), and the main contents.\nBut this is all a lie\u0026hellip;\nYou use ls probably all the time, but did you know there\u0026rsquo;s a -i option?\n-i, --inode print the index of the inode So what exactly is an inode and why all of a sudden can\u0026rsquo;t files live without it? An inode is a data structure that holds the metadata of the file. If we really want to define what a file is, it\u0026rsquo;s raw data and the pointer to inode that defines it.\nOk, but what are the directories then?\nDirectories are just the table of file names and inodes, that\u0026rsquo;s quite simple. But how can we use this knowledge except boasting about it at beer night? So there comes another myth\u0026hellip;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not quite right, you see on most file systems except ZFS, the inode count is set on file system creation.\nYou can check it using stat on /var/log/lastlog.\nIf you all of a sudden start creating a lot of files, you get a funny message:\nFile Creation Failures Due to Inode Exhaustion?\nThe limit of the inodes has been exceeded. It\u0026rsquo;s not as unusual as you might think. The cloud storage ain\u0026rsquo;t cheap, so if we request a small space and all of a sudden our server starts to utilize cache, we might very quickly find that despite having 3GB space left, the server can\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026hellip;\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s begin the examination. Processes are, by nature, greedy. They want much more than they can chew. That\u0026rsquo;s why they\u0026rsquo;re requesting far more RAM than they require. Thank God the kernel knows about it and also over-allocates the memory. So, from now on it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a surprise that your system is using 8.5 GB memory when it has only 8 GB because programs will use it over time, not instantaneously.\nYou think you kill programs, right?\nAll you usually do is ask nicely by sending a signal SIGTERM, which is politely saying, \u0026ldquo;Please stop.\u0026rdquo; To kill the process no matter what, you send SIGKILL or kill -9, and yes, it literally does the job.\nProcesses are usually killable, but there are two exceptions. Because a process has many states in its life, it can be stopped (meaning paused), or it can be asleep, or it can be in the eternal sleep. And that\u0026rsquo;s the issue when the process is in uninterrupted sleep; you can\u0026rsquo;t kill it. Usually, this happens when the process has hardware interactions or is waiting for certain kinds of kernel synchronization primitives.\nYou know what else doesn\u0026rsquo;t die easily? Zombies.\nZombies are just another state of the process. They don\u0026rsquo;t have to be dangerous. All they are is the product of the sloppiness of the programmer. So, when the parent process spawns small children and they achieve certain small goals, and then the parent process doesn\u0026rsquo;t clean them from the process table, they remain there but only as a record. Eventually, the kernel will get rid of them, but it\u0026rsquo;s a sign of some troublesome software.\nYou can create zombies on your own. Here is the formula:\nimport os, sys, time ttlForParent = 60; for i in range(0, 10): # This creates the copy of the main process as # a child process but with diffrent PID pid_1 = os.fork() print(pid_1) print(\u0026#34;Hello Worlds!!!\u0026#34;) if pid_1 == 0: sys.exit(); time.sleep(ttlForParent); os.wait() see the source\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re done check for your little creations\nps ux | awk \u0026#39;{if($8==\u0026#34;Z+\u0026#34;) print}\u0026#39; Remember that you can\u0026rsquo;t kill them because they are already dead. In order to get rid of them, you have to know one small detail about the process.\nLinux has so much more mysteries to discover. So, as you delve deeper into the Linux universe, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of the unexpected. Grab your terminal and explore the rabbit hole.\nP.S. Wish me luck for my CompTIA Linux+ examination.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/posts/linux_unmasked/","summary":"When you use an OS like Linux, you must constantly familiarize yourself with the feeling that you will be surprised by it.

Do you really need all those million features? Do you actually need blogger and e classrom?\nThink about it. Does your email client need to be as bloated as it is? Do you really want to wait forever for Gmail to load up every magnificent feature it has to offer?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a surprise: the email client in Go has only 2500 lines of code, and it was written nine years ago.

Some even chase digital dreams worth millions! But here\u0026rsquo;s the twist:\nInstead of digging into the systems behind all these treasures, they\u0026rsquo;re all about owning stuff on the web. It\u0026rsquo;s like they\u0026rsquo;re hunting for treasures without a map. What\u0026rsquo;s kinda funny is that I actually find the technology itself more intriguing than the supposed treasures it holds. But there\u0026rsquo;s always that nagging concern – what if some digital pirates come to snatch it all away? Well, there\u0026rsquo;s a cool trick called Zero-Knowledge Proofs\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like a math algorithm that lets you confirm stuff without giving away your secrets.\nTake cryptocurrency transactions, for example.\nYou can check your funds without revealing who you are or your password. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t quite grasp all the math behind it – I\u0026rsquo;m just a humble software developer. But you know what? The concept is like stumbling upon a hidden gem itself. If you wanna dive deeper into this, check out the video\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a fun watch!\nThen, you write down the instructions for what each account will do and who\u0026rsquo;s paying the bill for the execution and uptime (that\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026lsquo;gas fees\u0026rsquo; part).\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve got that sorted, you deploy it onto the devnet, and your app creates JavaScript types, that you will use to interact with the program. All you really need is a program public key (program id), because smart programs are essentially accounts themselves. And voila! You\u0026rsquo;re ready to interact with it, and it\u0026rsquo;s out there in the world, with all the records easily accessible.\nNow, for the fun part, tools like Anchor and Solana-CLI are like your very own playground in the blockchain world. They make it easy for developers to dive in and experiment, giving you a chance to go from zero to \u0026lsquo;rich\u0026rsquo; in seconds\u0026hellip; well, maybe \u0026rsquo;temporarily rich\u0026rsquo; is more like it (try Solana airdrop 2). If you ask me, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a shot. Building yet another dull CRUD app might just start feeling thrilling all over again. Plus, Solana even offers a native solana playground where you can test it out without configuring anything.\nThe actual image or any other data isn\u0026rsquo;t on the blockchain itself. It\u0026rsquo;s the proof that this digital asset belongs to you.\nThink about where ownership matters most?\nThe answer is gaming Items like skins, swords, characters, or avatars can become NFTs, allowing players to truly own and trade them. Traditional methods of selling entire game accounts fall short in the context of in-game economies. NFTs add a new layer to the gaming experience by enabling the transfer of specific items. Imagine being part of a special event within a game and having an NFT to prove your exclusive possession of something. It not only enhances the gaming experience but also lets you show off to your friends, thanks to your ownership details right there on the blockchain. NFTs aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to gaming, though. Companies can use them to guarantee authenticity and traceability.\nLearn More\nFor example, if you run a shop selling T-shirts, you can record each transaction on the blockchain, showcasing purchases from eco-friendly providers. Later, when the item is ready, you can create an NFT with a link to the entire production process. This allows consumers to verify the legitimacy of their purchase. The beauty of it is that you\u0026rsquo;re not restricted to existing blockchains. But I\u0026rsquo;ll save that topic for another post\u0026hellip;\nJust remember, blockchain isn\u0026rsquo;t just about sketchy stuff. It\u0026rsquo;s a whole playground waiting to be explored. Beyond all the hype, there are some cool hidden features and possibilities to discover. It\u0026rsquo;s not just about shady deals; blockchain can bring some exciting innovations to the table. So, don\u0026rsquo;t let the noise get in the way of finding some awesome opportunities in this world of blockchain tech.\nGreat Starting Point for Blockchain\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/posts/the_gold_is_in_the_block/","summary":"People often find excitement in the world of crypto, blockchain, and NFTs, only to fall victim to scams or invest in worthless tokens.

You pick up the pen, only to realize that after a long day, you struggle to recall anything significant. Or worse, there's an overwhelming amount to write about, leaving you torn between writing it all and watching TV with your favorite anime girlfriend. *Fortunately, we have computers*... Computers log everything Booting, crashes, and now even your browser activity. Recently, Microsoft announced their new killer feature called Copilot Recall. It\u0026rsquo;s a personal LLM that logs every keystroke and every action you do on your computer, essentially taking screenshots every 5 seconds if the content on your desktop changes.\nMicrosoft even designed a dedicated chip to support this AI model, called the Turbocharged NPU.\nHere are the requirements:\n-A Copilot Plus PC with the special chip\n-16 GB of RAM\n-8 processors\n-256 GB storage\n-50 GB memory storage\n-An additional 25 GB for all the screenshots\nWith this, you won\u0026rsquo;t have to remember anything. A tool that, after six months, will recall what nasty OnlyFans video you watched or why your friend was wrong about Bill Gates.\nThis is a bad example of logging.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not like capturing moments isn\u0026rsquo;t important, but sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s better to forget.\nIf you watched \u0026lsquo;The Entire History of You\u0026rsquo;, the third episode of the first season of Black Mirror, you\u0026rsquo;ll quickly understand how destructive this can be for human psychology.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s easy; we can always go to therapy.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more worrying is that someone else can see everything we do. Although Microsoft claims that this will remain only on your local computer (for now!), this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it less vulnerable.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also closed-source, so you don’t have any idea whether this is true. Imagine a malicious actor getting access to the contents of this vector database.\nThey would have literally everything. Considering it\u0026rsquo;s a new feature, there will likely be many bugs and vulnerabilities. It\u0026rsquo;s already possible with just two lines of code, as they’re just files in AppData, in the new CoreAIPlatform folder.\nFor more information, check this article: How to do it.\nToday, however, I want to present a more positive side of logging, the balance between privacy and functionality. Please welcome our todays guest , journalctl.\nThe only journal worth reading\nA Small Introduction Journalctl is an honorable member of the systemd tools suite.\nIt manages the logging portion of all the units.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to know that its logs are binary.\nThis means you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to see them directly, but it also saves you quite a lot of space.\nIf you want to know whether journalctl is enabled, check out /etc/systemd/journald.conf.\nYou should have Storage set to persistent.\nIf not, change this and run sudo systemctl reload systemd-journald.\n(because journalctl is also a unit by itself)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re ever worried that journalctl will take all your space, try this command to realize how little space that amount of information takes:\njournalctl --disk-usage How Does journalctl Think? Journalctl views the changing reality of your system in eight categories.\nThis mindset is called structured logging, and it\u0026rsquo;s worth adopting.\nUsually, when we log something in an application, we think of it as a simple statement—perhaps noting an error or confirming that execution was successful.\nSome of us, especially more advanced users, add timestamps and exit codes to the logging architecture.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s good, but there\u0026rsquo;s one issue: it’s really hard to know what is what.\nIs it a warning, an error, or maybe a notice that I have to change my configuration?\nAs the log grows, it becomes even harder to search for errors or alerts.\nThat’s why people use packages like log/slog to make the logging searchable and manageable.\nRemember that structured logs can be parsed in any format.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t like JSON, no problem—there\u0026rsquo;s XML or even a CSV version.\nTo search for a particular priority in journalctl, we use:\n-p or --priority=number Of course, you can search for multiple priorities with:\njournalctl -p 4..6 Most components of our computers are units.\nWe can usually add the -u flag, or since systemd is the parent of all processes, we can use filters by UID, GID, or PID:\njournalctl _PID=1234 This structured approach allows you to quickly filter and find specific types of log messages, making system administration more efficient.\nWe Are Surrounded by Sessions Yoga sessions, therapy sessions, browser sessions , sessions are everywhere. journalctl is no exception; it keeps things real with its boot session\nTo list them, just type:\njournalctl --list-boots Number 0 is the current boot session (a small tribute to programmers).\nTo pick a specific boot session, you can use the -b flag followed by the boot number.\nFor example, to view the logs from the previous boot session, you can use:\njournalctl -b -1 But journalctl isn\u0026rsquo;t alone; there are many more journalists among us\u0026hellip;\nWho Watches Last, Lastb? Somebody’s Watching Me? I always feel like Somebody\u0026rsquo;s Watching Me\u0026hellip; Such a good tune, truly a fan. But back to the point.\nHave you ever wondered how to check the first time you successfully logged into the system? I bet you don\u0026rsquo;t me neither.\nUsually, we skip the successful logins because we live in a single-user environment, meaning if somebody logged in successfully, it should be us.\nBut we forget that these files don\u0026rsquo;t only check for logging into the system.\nThey check for any other login protocols like SSH, RDP, VNC, you name it. Sometimes, we forget to set up the password and a simple ssh-copy-id on our local network might be devastating.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s useful to check from time to time to ensure we are alone.\nHowever, if we set up everything properly in terms of security—authentication, password, etc.—or we have a server, there\u0026rsquo;s lastb that comes in handy. Can you guess what it does? Usually, the Linux commands are pretty self-explanatory, but I had a hard time memorizing this one.\nThe answer: it logs the failed logins to the system. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting is you can\u0026rsquo;t view this command without sudo (unlike last).\nTo check successful logins, use:\nlast To check failed login attempts, use:\nsudo lastb All of Us Are Peeping Toms Somewhere Deep Down That\u0026rsquo;s why the w command was invented.\nIt lets us see what users are doing on our system in real-time. What\u0026rsquo;s funny is you can use watch w to get real-time updates.\nSo many watchers!\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough, there\u0026rsquo;s also a program called whowatch which not only displays what the user is doing but also lets you kill the processes they run in real-time.\nUnfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit outdated the last commit was two years ago\n(I\u0026rsquo;m already thinking of rewriting this in Go since it\u0026rsquo;s such a nice feature for sysadmins).\nSo, if you want to mess up a 3-hour download of somebody\u0026rsquo;s game, feel free\u0026hellip;\nTo see what users are doing, use:\nw To get real-time updates, use:\nwatch w To use whowatch, which might need to be installed first:\nsudo apt-get install whowatch whowatch Logs Are Everywhere, You Just Have to Reach for Them Unfortunately, in the Linux world, we tend to skip any form of reading logs because it\u0026rsquo;s much simpler and quicker to create a new machine or to format it than to traverse through the logs. But this is the wrong way of thinking.\nIt completely falls short when it comes to future problem-solving abilities. We just run from the problem.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to know that when you understand how the logs work and you try it, you gain something that is priceless. You truly know what\u0026rsquo;s going on with your system.\nThis means there won\u0026rsquo;t be any missing patches or broken processes that an attacker can use against you. There won\u0026rsquo;t be any random crashes or kernel issues.\nYour system will be completely stable.\nAnd trust me, stability in the time we live in is invaluable.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have a story about catching someone red-handed trying to break into my system\n(although I recently saw a cool project about creating an easy web honeypot and catching bots in Go and really want to try it).\nBut I remember when I struggled with the Qtile configuration, trying to get it right, constantly killing it, changing the code, and logging in\nit was a nightmare.\nEventually, I left this and never came back, but there was a remedy for this. All I had to do was to read the Qtile log file at ~/.local/share/qtile/qtile.log, and I would have known what I messed up.\nTo Sum Up Logging doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be scary (despite Microsoft demonizing it). I hope I convinced you to at least try it for fun with whowatch or to explore how programmers design their logs. Sometimes it might be hard to keep track of everything, I know this. In the next post, I will try to show you that you can make it far easier by creating audits.\nBut for now, peace out and remember: journalct is the only journal worth reading.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/posts/the_only_journal_worth_reading/","summary":"Everyone has that moment in their life when they think, \u0026quot;Maybe today is the day I'll start journaling.\u0026quot; It's just a fleeting thought.

Error handling is minimal, apart from test statements or exit codes.\nBash is slow; what works for 100 repetitions doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for a million.\nThe universal rule is:\nIf your script is longer than 40 lines, use a programming language.\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s the alternatvie then? Typically, when you start automating tasks like setting up virtual machines and managing dot-files, you want them to be set up quickly, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re unsure which hypervisor tools to use. You can either set up a dot-files repository with scripts that symlink things to proper places or do it manually for every VM.\nSome of you may have built scripts around SSH.\nssh user@hostname \u0026#34;apt install ...\u0026#34; But this isn\u0026rsquo;t maintainable.\nAs your home lab grows, you\u0026rsquo;ll have more things to configure simultaneously: different machines, package managers, environments, and different types of errors.\nTrust me, elaborate scripts won\u0026rsquo;t hold up. You need a better tool. Here comes Ansible, a daemon-less solution\u0026hellip;\nSo, it\u0026rsquo;s quite simple. Ansible is built around pushing changes using a tool you already love SSH.\nAnsible connects to the selected machine and pushes changes based on instructions stored in a YAML file, called a playbook.\nNo matter how many machines you have, Ansible is quick, simple, and nice, without the need to install any daemon on the nodes.\nInstallation Installing Ansible is relatively simple. You have two approaches:\nTreat Ansible as a project with its own virtual environment. Install it as a system-wide package. You might think the second option, global installation, is far superior.\nHowever, Ansible uses Python modules installed on your system.\nImagine needing to install a Python library for virtualization.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d have to install it system-wide, which could lead to compatibility issues later.\nMoreover, you\u0026rsquo;re giving administrative privileges to the package.\nIf the package is malicious or contains vulnerabilities, it can exploit those privileges.\nInstallation Methods\nsudo apt update sudo apt install ansible Or with virtual env:\npip install virtualenv virtualenv ansible-env source ansible-env/bin/activate pip install ansible pip install ansible-core Inventory I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ve already added your lab machines to the SSH config so you can easily SSH into them.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t, here\u0026rsquo;s how to do it:\n# Create a config file in ~/.ssh and add the following lines for hosts Host ChooseAnyName HostName ip_address User username_to_connect_as IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private key Remember to change the authorization method on your server to PublicKey, so you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to --ask-pass every time you want to use Ansible.\nNow, having done all of this, you need to create a file called inventory and add the host names to it. This tells Ansible which device to SSH into and perform tasks.\n[home] dnf my_machine1 my_machine2 [home] is the name of the group, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to call each machine manually one by one.\nFocus on Debugging First We won\u0026rsquo;t write any serious playbooks in this post; I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that for another time. But I want you to understand Ansible\u0026rsquo;s modularity and its debugging potential so you can apply quick fixes without writing the whole playbook.\nAnsible Ad Hoc and Modularity Ansible itself is a suite of tools and modules.\nYou have different commands for different tasks.\nFor example, to get knowledge about a particular module, you use:\nansible-docs -s module_name Modules work similarly to Python modules.\nYou can call modules alone using the -m flag.\nOne popular example is the venv package, which creates a virtual environment for Python:\npython -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment Similarly, in Ansible, you use this pattern:\nansible home -i path_to_inventory -m module_name -a \u0026#39;module arguemnt\u0026#39; There are thousands of modules in Ansible, but I want to focus on two that will be most useful for you:\nSetup Module Shell Module Setup Quick and Dirty There are many situations where you\u0026rsquo;d like to quickly gather information about your infrastructure.\nAre all your machines working? What\u0026rsquo;s their uptime? Do they have the right kernel version?\nHere are the all possible options:\nansible test -i inventory -m setup -a \u0026#39;filter=user_id\u0026#39; ansible test -i inventory -m setup -a \u0026#39;filter=kernel\u0026#39; ansible test -i inventory -m setup -a \u0026#39;filter=ansible_distribution\u0026#39; Ansible Can Be Sneaky You might think Ansible processes tasks one by one, but it actually handles them in parallel.\nBy default, it handles 5 machines, but you can specify more by adding the -f flag:\nansible test -i inventory -m setup -a \u0026#39;filter=user_id\u0026#39; -f 10 It also hides what it\u0026rsquo;s really doing, which could make extended debugging challenging.\nTherefore, you have to explicitly call it with the verbosity flag.\nIt has up to 6 \u0026lsquo;v\u0026rsquo;s !!!, but a reasonable level to start is -vvv, feel free to go wild:\nansible test -i inventory -m setup -a \u0026#39;filter=user_id\u0026#39; -vvvvvv Finally, Back to Bash This is the most dirty and basic but very useful. If you have a custom script you want to run or if there\u0026rsquo;s no Ansible module that suits your needs.\nYou can call Bash directly on the device with the shell module:\nansible test -i inventory -m shell -a \u0026#39;any_command_you_desire\u0026#39; However, there\u0026rsquo;s a catch:\nAnsible doesn\u0026rsquo;t control the output.\nIt executes the command and checks for errors but always produces a changed result, no matter what the command is.\nTo Sum Up Bash scripts have their time and place but are not the one and only solution, especially for something you may use on multiple devices.\nTry something more stable that won\u0026rsquo;t shoot you in the foot but guide you.\nReally, Ansible is awesome, and that\u0026rsquo;s just the beginning of its possibilities.\nIf you want to learn more about Ansible, Linux, or anything else, chekout killercoda labs\nThey are free, no need for login, and will walk you through everything without setting up the environment.\nAlso, join their Discord channel because they\u0026rsquo;re doing a fantastic job educating about Linux.\nPeace out :) Hope to see you there!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/posts/the_world_doesn_t_end_with_scripting/","summary":"When you start your Linux journey or follow Linux-based YouTubers, you often hear them praising the benefits of writing scripts.\nThey encourage you to create your own scripts for various tasks because\n\u0026ldquo;scripts are simple yet powerful tools to get your work done.\u0026rdquo;\nThey suggest downloading and using scripts to experience these benefits firsthand, advocating for Bash as the go-to scripting language due to its versatility and ease of use.","title":"the_world_doesn_t_end_with_scripting"},{"content":"--- date:: 24 04 2023 type:: network+ Threads Each process is started with a sigle thread called primary thread but can run additional threads ThreadsGrap_visual.png Multithreades Differece between the [processes_kernel](/obisdian_ntoes/for later/processes_kernel.md) ProcessVsThreads_visual.png\n[!quote] handle Kernel\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/for_later/threads/","summary":"--- date:: 24 04 2023 type:: network+ Threads Each process is started with a sigle thread called primary thread but can run additional threads ThreadsGrap_visual.png Multithreades Differece between the [processes_kernel](/obisdian_ntoes/for later/processes_kernel.md) ProcessVsThreads_visual.png\n[!quote] handle Kernel","title":"threads"},{"content":"--- date:: 2023-08-30 type:: network+ Three-tier architecteru Core The center of the network Web servers databases applications Many people require access (usually access switch nearby) ==Useres do not connect direcly to the core== Distribution A midpoitn bettwen the path and the users Communicate between access switches Menage path and end user Access Where users connect End stations printers [!tip]- sfhhjskfshjfsk\n[!quote] SDN\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/three-tier_architecture_net_arch/","summary":"--- date:: 2023-08-30 type:: network+ Three-tier architecteru Core The center of the network Web servers databases applications Many people require access (usually access switch nearby) ==Useres do not connect direcly to the core== Distribution A midpoitn bettwen the path and the users Communicate between access switches Menage path and end user Access Where users connect End stations printers [!tip]- sfhhjskfshjfsk\n[!quote] SDN","title":"three-tier architecture_net_arch"},{"content":"--- date:: 2023-08-02 type:: Protocol TLS session When a connection is established between a client and a server\nTLS protocol allows them to negotiate the encryption parameters and establish a secure channel for communication Handshake: The client and server initiate a TLS handshake.

Slowing down your requests can sometimes help. Techniques: Randomized Intervals: Instead of sending requests at a constant interval, randomize the times at which you send requests. Request Headers Customizing request headers can make bots less detectable. Techniques: User Agents: Rotate user-agent strings to mimic different browsers and devices. Referrers: Use realistic referrer URLs. IPs and Networking Avoid detection by changing your network attributes. Techniques: IP Rotation: Rotate through a list of proxy servers so that requests appear to come from multiple users. Residential Proxies: Use residential IPs instead of datacenter IPs as some websites block or limit datacenter IPs. Behavioral Mimicry Simulating human-like behavior can sometimes make bots harder to detect. Techniques: Human Behavior Simulation: Adding random clicks, mouse movements, and scroll actions. Sequential Page Navigation: Access pages in a sequence that a human might follow. CAPTCHAs Some scraping activities might trigger CAPTCHAs, which are designed to distinguish bots from humans. Techniques: Manual Intervention: For CAPTCHAs, some services allow for manual human intervention to solve them. CAPTCHA Solving Services: There are also automated services that claim to solve CAPTCHAs, though these are often against the terms of service of most websites. Cookies and Sessions Maintaining state between requests can also be useful. Techniques: Session Maintenance: Keep track of cookies to maintain sessions, which can sometimes bypass security checks. LocalStorage and JavaScript: Some advanced scrapers maintain a JavaScript environment to mimic human interactions better. Request Timing Timing your requests can also play a role in avoiding detection. Techniques: Day Parting: Some scrapers find success in only sending requests during specific hours Web Drivers Some scrapers use real browsers to simulate interactions more convincingly. Techniques: Real Browsers: Use a real browser driver like Selenium or Puppeteer. Disclaimer: Remember that even if you\u0026rsquo;re not blocked by a website, your actions can still be illegal or against the terms of service of the website you\u0026rsquo;re interacting with. Always respect robots.txt and terms of service, and when in doubt, seek legal advice.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/bots_gtp_recomendations/","summary":"Rate Limiting Strategies for Web Scraping Slow Down Requests Many simple bot detectors trigger based on the request rate.

Actually, the terminal window doesn&rsquo;t launch processes, they&rsquo;re launched by the shell session inside the terminal window.
The simple and elegant solution to that problem is to place another process between the shell session and the program, and have that middle-layer program never pass on the SIGHUP signal.">

<p>A dynamic array, also known as  a <strong>vector</strong>, provides array access with the ability to grow dynamically when needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Runtime Complexity:</strong> O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.</li>
<li><strong>Main Vectors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Length:</em> Tracks the number of elements currently stored in the array.</li>
<li><em>Capacity/Size</em> Represents the total size of the array, including both used and unused slots.</li>
<li><em>Deletion:</em> Removing elements from the array might require shifting elements to fill the gap, but the actual value doesn&rsquo;t have to be deleted since the length keeps track of what is in the array.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expending">Expending</h3>
<p>When exceeding the capacity of the array, a new array with increased capacity is created, and all existing elements are <strong>copied</strong> to the new array.</p>
<h3 id="queue-like-operations">Queue-Like Operations</h3>
<p>Dynamic arrays can be used to implement queue-like operations efficiently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enqueuing:</strong> Adding elements to the end of the array might require shifting elements if the capacity is exceeded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dequeuing:</strong> Removing elements from the front of the array requires shifting all remaining elements to the left to fill the gap created by dequeuing.</p>

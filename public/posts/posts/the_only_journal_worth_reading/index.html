<h3 id="computers-log-everything">Computers log everything</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/Microsoft-Recall-Title.jpg" alt="Micorsoft recall"></p>
<p>Booting, crashes, and now even your browser activity. Recently, Microsoft announced their new killer feature called Copilot <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/privacy-and-control-over-your-recall-experience-d404f672-7647-41e5-886c-a3c59680af15">Recall</a>.
It&rsquo;s a personal LLM that logs every keystroke and every action you do on your computer, essentially taking screenshots every 5 seconds if the content on your desktop changes.</p>
<p>Microsoft even designed a dedicated chip to support this AI model, called the Turbocharged NPU.</p>
<p>Here are the requirements:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>-A Copilot Plus PC with the special chip</p>
<p>-16 GB of RAM</p>
<p>-8 processors</p>
<p>-256 GB storage</p>
<p>-50 GB memory storage</p>
<p>-An additional 25 GB for all the screenshots</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With this, you won&rsquo;t have to remember anything. A tool that, after six months, will recall what nasty OnlyFans video you watched or why your friend was wrong about Bill Gates.</p>
<p><em>This is a bad example of logging</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s not like capturing moments isn&rsquo;t important, but sometimes it&rsquo;s better to forget.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you  watched <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/black_mirror/s01/e03">&lsquo;The Entire History of You&rsquo;</a>, the third episode of the first season of <em>Black Mirror</em>, you&rsquo;ll quickly understand how destructive this can be for human psychology.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But it&rsquo;s easy; we can always go to therapy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What&rsquo;s more worrying is that someone else can see everything we do. Although Microsoft claims that this will remain only on your local computer <em>(for now!)</em>, this doesn&rsquo;t make it less vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s also closed-source</strong>, so you don’t have any idea whether this is true. Imagine a malicious actor getting access to the contents of this vector database.</p>
<p>They would have literally everything. Considering it&rsquo;s a new feature, there will likely be many bugs and vulnerabilities. It&rsquo;s already possible with just two lines of code, as they’re just files in <strong>AppData</strong>, in the new <strong>CoreAIPlatform</strong> folder.</p>
<p>For more information, check this article: <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e">How to do it</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today, however, I want to present a more positive side of logging, the balance between privacy and functionality. Please welcome our todays guest , <strong>journalctl</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The only journal worth reading</strong></p>
<h3 id="a-small-introduction">A Small Introduction</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/logging_meeme.jpeg" alt="We need more logs meme"></p>
<p><strong>Journalctl</strong> is an honorable member of the systemd tools suite.</p>
<p>It manages the logging portion of all the units.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know that its <strong>logs are binary</strong>.</p>
<p>This means you won&rsquo;t be able to see them directly, but it also saves you quite a lot of space.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you want to know whether <strong>journalctl</strong> is enabled, check out <em>/etc/systemd/journald.conf</em>.</p>
<p>You should have Storage set to <strong>persistent</strong>.</p>
<p>If not, change this and run <strong>sudo systemctl reload systemd-journald</strong>.</p>
<p>(<em>because <strong>journalctl</strong> is also a unit by itself</em>)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever worried that <strong>journalctl</strong> will take all your space, try this command to realize how little space that amount of information takes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>journalctl --disk-usage
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="how-does-journalctl-think">How Does journalctl Think?</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/journal_levels.png" alt="Journalctl levels"></p>
<p><strong>Journalctl</strong> views the changing reality of your system in eight categories.</p>
<p>This mindset is called <strong>structured logging</strong>, and it&rsquo;s worth adopting.</p>
<p>Usually, when we log something in an application, we think of it as a simple statement—perhaps noting an error or confirming that execution was successful.</p>
<p>Some of us, especially more advanced users, add timestamps and exit codes to the logging architecture.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good, but there&rsquo;s one issue: it’s really hard to know what is what.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Is it a warning, an error, or maybe a notice that I have to change my configuration?</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As the log grows, it becomes even harder to search for errors or alerts.</p>
<p>That’s why people use packages like <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog">log/slog</a> to make the logging searchable and manageable.</p>
<p>Remember that structured logs <strong>can be parsed in any format</strong>.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like JSON, no problem—there&rsquo;s XML or even a CSV version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To search for a particular priority in <strong>journalctl</strong>, we use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>-p or --priority<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>number
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course, you can search for multiple priorities with:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>journalctl -p 4..6
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most components of our computers are <strong>units</strong>.</p>
<p>We can usually add the <strong>-u</strong> flag, or since <code>systemd</code> is the parent of all processes, we can use filters by <strong>UID</strong>, <strong>GID</strong>, or <strong>PID</strong>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>journalctl _PID<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1234</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This structured approach allows you to quickly filter and find specific types of log messages, making system administration more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-surrounded-by-sessions">We Are Surrounded by Sessions</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/seesion.png" alt="Session picutre"></p>
<p>Yoga sessions, therapy sessions, browser sessions ,  sessions are everywhere. journalctl is no exception; it keeps things real with its <strong>boot session</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To list them, just type:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>journalctl --list-boots
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Number <strong>0</strong> is the <strong>current boot session</strong> (<em>a small tribute to programmers</em>).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To pick a specific boot session, you can use the <strong>-b</strong> flag followed by the boot number.</p>
<p>For example, to view the logs from the previous boot session, you can use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>journalctl -b -1
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But <strong>journalctl</strong> isn&rsquo;t alone; there are many more journalists among us&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="who-watches-last-lastb-somebodys-watching-me">Who Watches Last, Lastb? Somebody’s Watching Me?</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/somboeiesWatching.jpg" alt="Somebodys watching singer "></p>
<p>I always feel like  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvAYIJSSZY">Somebody&rsquo;s Watching Me&hellip; </a></p>
<p>Such a good tune, truly a fan. But back to the point.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Have you ever wondered how to check the first time you successfully logged into the system? I bet you don&rsquo;t me neither.</p>
<p>Usually, we skip the successful logins because we live in a single-user environment, meaning if somebody logged in successfully, it should be us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But we forget that these files don&rsquo;t only check for logging into the system.</p>
<p>They check for any other login protocols like <em>SSH, RDP, VNC,</em> you name it. Sometimes, we forget to set up the password and a simple <strong>ssh-copy-id</strong> on our local network might be devastating.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s useful to check from time to time to ensure we are alone.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, if we set up everything properly in terms of security—authentication, password, etc.—or we have a server, there&rsquo;s <strong>lastb</strong> that comes in handy. Can you guess what it does? Usually, the Linux commands are pretty self-explanatory, but I had a hard time memorizing this one.</p>
<p>The answer: it logs the failed logins to the system. What&rsquo;s interesting is you can&rsquo;t view this command without sudo (unlike <strong>last</strong>).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To check successful logins, use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>last
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To check failed login attempts, use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo lastb
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="all-of-us-are-peeping-toms-somewhere-deep-down">All of Us Are Peeping Toms Somewhere Deep Down</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/peeping.png" alt="Pair peeping on friends"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the <strong>w</strong> command was invented.</p>
<p>It lets us see what users are doing on our system in real-time. What&rsquo;s funny is you can use <strong>watch w</strong> to get real-time updates.</p>
<p><strong>So many watchers!</strong></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough, there&rsquo;s also a program called <a href="https://github.com/qrichert/WoWatch">whowatch</a> which not only displays what the user is doing but also lets you kill the processes they run in real-time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a bit outdated the last commit was <em>two years ago</em></p>
<p>(<em>I&rsquo;m already thinking of rewriting this in Go since it&rsquo;s such a nice feature for sysadmins</em>).</p>
<p>So, if you want to mess up a 3-hour download of somebody&rsquo;s game, feel free&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To see what users are doing, use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>w
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To get real-time updates, use:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>watch w
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To use <strong>whowatch</strong>, which might need to be installed first:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo apt-get install whowatch
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>whowatch
</span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="logs-are-everywhere-you-just-have-to-reach-for-them">Logs Are Everywhere, You Just Have to Reach for Them</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/what_doesThe_log_say.png" alt="What does the log say"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the Linux world, we tend to skip any form of reading logs because it&rsquo;s much simpler and quicker to create a new machine or to format it than to traverse through the logs. But this is the wrong way of thinking.</p>
<p>It completely falls short when it comes to future problem-solving abilities. We just run from the problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know that when you understand how the logs work and you try it, you gain something that is priceless. You truly know what&rsquo;s going on with your system.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This means there <em>won&rsquo;t be any missing patches or broken processes</em> that an attacker can use against you. There won&rsquo;t be any random crashes or kernel issues.</p>
<p><strong>Your system will be completely stable.</strong></p>
<p>And trust me, stability in the time we live in is invaluable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a story about catching someone red-handed trying to break into my system</p>
<p>(<em>although I recently saw a cool project about creating an easy <a href="https://github.com/ryanolee/go-pot">web honeypot</a> and catching bots in Go and really want to try it</em>).</p>
<p>But I remember when I struggled with the Qtile configuration, trying to get it right, constantly killing it, changing the code, and logging in</p>
<p>it was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Eventually, I left this and never came back, but there was a remedy for this. All I had to do was to read the Qtile log file at <em>~/.local/share/qtile/qtile.log</em>, and I would have known what I messed up.</p>
<h3 id="to-sum-up">To Sum Up</h3>
<p>Logging doesn&rsquo;t have to be scary (despite Microsoft demonizing it). I hope I convinced you to at least try it for fun with <strong>whowatch</strong> or to explore how programmers design their logs. Sometimes it might be hard to keep track of everything, I know this. In the next post, I will try to show you that you can make it far easier by creating audits.</p>
<p>But for now, peace out and remember: <strong>journalct</strong> is the only journal worth reading.</p>

<p><strong>Can IT professionals beat the alpha male?</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I know, I know you think that people who spend most of their time behind a screen, repairing printers and watching anime, can&rsquo;t be equal to <em>Andrew Tate</em> or any other self-proclaimed guru.</p>
<p>You might see us as a bunch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_594mPXoHMI">quiche  eating  nerds</a> who have no lives or girlfriends.</p>
<p>But think again. <strong>We&rsquo;re the Davids in this battle, and we all know how that story ends</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="were-the-builders">We&rsquo;re the Builders</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/sucumb_to_tech/unsucesfullbuild.webp" alt="Building softwere meme"></p>
<p><strong>When was the last time you built something?</strong></p>
<p>Not just blindly copied data into an Excel sheet or sent an email, but truly created something?</p>
<p>Creation is one of our primary human instincts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the feeling that something is truly yours, that you have control over it.</p>
<p><strong>As IT professionals, we create things every day.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how shitty it is.</p>
<p>Your code might not be optimized; a simple for-loop might take two hours to run.</p>
<p><em>But it&rsquo;s yours.</em></p>
<p>From automation scripts to building computers from scratch, we are constantly creating.</p>
<p>We even build the web so you can brag about your problems and sell your  ponzi schemes.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;re the builders.</strong></p>
<h3 id="we-love-our-tools">We Love Our Tools</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/sucumb_to_tech/setupjoke.png" alt="Proggraming setup meme"></p>
<p>Emacs, Vim, Linux, Windows, React, Solid, Ranger, vifm we know them inside and out.</p>
<p>While most people watch Netflix in their free time, we tinker with configuration files.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s our fetish.</em></p>
<p>But oh boy, how smooth the experience is.</p>
<p>Our world is all about <strong>DX</strong> (<em>Developer Experience</em>) and positive laziness.</p>
<p><strong>We love automation.</strong></p>
<p>Do you think all these dotfiles are moved manually?</p>
<p>For every action you do, we have a bot, a shortcut, or a script ready.</p>
<p><em>One day, we will automate everything so thoroughly that we won&rsquo;t be needed anymore&hellip;</em></p>
<h3 id="were-the-learners">We&rsquo;re the learners</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/sucumb_to_tech/obsidian_setup.jpeg" alt="Obsidian setup"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve thought at least once in your life that what you learn in school won&rsquo;t help you in the real world.</p>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s no such thought here because there&rsquo;s no school. It&rsquo;s just you and your text editor.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly liberating because you find the purpose for learning.</p>
<p><strong>You learn because you want solve your problem, not just to pass a test.</strong></p>
<p>The hands-on experience is constantly intertwined with theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>We seek knowledge and have unlimited resources #Google.</p>
<p>Here,you&rsquo;re never hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>But really read the f&hellip; manual</strong></p>
<p>If you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed, you can always find a way to abstract the problem.</p>
<p>We use abstraction to not just solve issues but to simplify and transform complex concepts into manageable, understandable pieces.</p>
<p>U see one day the abstraction will literally blow your mind.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-the-community">We are the community</h3>
<p><img src="/blog_imgs/sucumb_to_tech/how_to_fit.jpg" alt="How to be a linux user video"></p>
<p>People might dive in, gushing about tools and programming languages, but when they see you creating, they&rsquo;re always ready to help.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;ve done before. What matters is that now you&rsquo;re one of us.</strong></p>
<p>We love to see new faces and fresh ideas.</p>
<p>We have countless Discord channels and communities where we share and collaborate, embracing everyone who joins.</p>
<p>My friend  used to say, <em>&ldquo;IT is such a broad field that it will accept anyone&rdquo;</em> and that&rsquo;s what ultimately drew me to this mentality.</p>
<p><strong>Here, you&rsquo;ll find what you love because we have it all.</strong></p>
<p>From stereotypical programming to UX development, system administration, data science, and tech marketing.</p>
<p>Pick your poison,</p>
<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to be a programmer</strong>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of roles that don&rsquo;t require coding.</p>
<p><em>What we need from you is to succumb  to the tech lifestyle.</em></p>
<h4 id="to-sum-up">To sum up</h4>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve picked your champion  because the evidence is overwhelming&hellip;</p>
<p>Either way, peace out for now.</p>
<p>Future projects won&rsquo;t build themselves</p>
<p>PS:
Looking forward to the epic rap battle between the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen/featured">Primogen</a> and Andrew Tate!</p>

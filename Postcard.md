Postcard
Some of us are photographers.
I only wanted to take a mental note.
There’s not much to talk about,
Just a few souvenirs,
A couple of postcards of what was left.

It was never about the people,
Although they can't complain.
Their need for attention was always met 
They were like words,
Destroyed when put into definitions.

I existed through their character,
Their flawed sense of intimacy.
I had nothing to share,
But they were there.

Now there’s only me and the stone,
And I can't take a look at myself...

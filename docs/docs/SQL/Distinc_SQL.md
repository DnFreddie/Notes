    Distinct

When we are examining data in a table, it can be helpful to know
what *distinct* values exist in a particular column.

[`DISTINCT`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/select-distinct?page_ref:%20catalog) is
used to return unique values in the output. It filters out all duplicate
values in the specified column(s).

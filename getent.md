Retrieve entries from various databases

 - *passwd* (user account) 
 - *group* (group account), 
 - *hosts* (hostnames and IP addresses), and services (network services) databases.
	 - It is particularly useful for querying system databases, providing a consistent interface across different Unix-like operating systems.
 
```bash
getent  passwd  aura
```

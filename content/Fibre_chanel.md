## Fibre Channel

==FC== A specialized high-speed topology: - Connects server to storage -
2, 4, 8, and 16 gigabit per second
[bandwidth](/Network/Phisicall/bandwidth) - Supported over
**both** [Fiber](/Network/Phisicall/Fiber) and
[Copper](/Network/Phisicall/Copper)

**Servers and storage** connect to a Fiber Channel switch: - Server
(*initiator*) needs a **FC interface** - Storage (*target*) is commonly
referenced by SCSI, SAS, and SATA commands

**Alternatives**: - [FCoE](/FCoE)

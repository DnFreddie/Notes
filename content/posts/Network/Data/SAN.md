## Storage Area Network

- Looks like a local storage device 
	- Block-level access 
		- Very efficient reading and writing
			- If u want to change a small peace of the file u don't have to overwrite the entire file 
- **Requiters a lot of** [bandwidth]({{< ref "posts/Network/Phisicall/bandwidth.md" >}}) 
	May use an isolated network
	 And high speed network tech

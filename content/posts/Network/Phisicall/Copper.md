## Copper cables

-   Balanced pair operation
    -   Two wires wit equal and opposite signalls
    -   Transmi+ Tranismit-/Recive+,Recive-
-   **The twist is the secret**
    -   Keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interfernce
    -   The opposite signals are compared on the other end
-   Extensive installation
    -   Relativly inexpensive
    -   Easy to install and maintain
-   Limited [bandwidth](/Notes/posts/Network/Phisicall/bandwidth)
    avaliabity
    -   *Psychics limits electrical signals through copper*
-   Used in [WAN](/Notes/posts/Network/Network_Types/WAN)
    -   cable modem [DSL](/Notes/posts/Network/Phisicall/DSL)
-   Often comabined with fiber

### Coaxial cables

-   Two or more forms share a common axis
-   Rg-6 used in televison/digital cable
    -   AND high speed internet over cablee

        Twinaxial cable Two inner conductors (*Twins*)
-   Common on 10 Gigabit
    [Ethernet](/Notes/posts/Network/Ref_OSI/Ethernet) SFP+ cables
    -   full duplex
    -   five meters
    -   low cost
    -   low [Latency](/Notes/posts/Network/Data/Latency) commpared to

## Transmission Control Protocol

It makes sure that data is transmmited in reaiable way

[PAR](/Notes/posts/for_later/PAR) -
<mark style="background: #72083D;">TCP is a connection base system
</mark> - U have to establisch the connetion with the device to send the
packet - **Ordering** - Tcp headers contains *sequence numbers* so if
the data get out of order during the transportation - If the packet is
*missing* we can request for the lost one - **Flow Control** - The
reciver can manage how much data is sent ## Flags

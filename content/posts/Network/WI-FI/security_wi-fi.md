## Security

*This is the security protocol used on the Wi-Fi AP that is being read
from. There are three primary security protocols for Wi-Fi.* - The
original, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), was badly flawed and eas-ily
cracked. - Its replacement, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), was a bit
moresecure. - Finally, WPA2-PSK, which is much more secure and uses a
pre-shared key (PSK) that all users share, is now used by nearly all
Wi-FiAPs (except enterprise Wi-Fi).

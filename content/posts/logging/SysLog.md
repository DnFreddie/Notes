*Linux uses a daemon called syslogd to automatically log events on your
com­ puter. Several variations of syslog, including
[rsyslog](/Notes/posts/logging/rsyslog) and syslog-ng, are used on
different distributions of Linux, and even though they operate very
simi­larly, some minor differences exist.*

*Linux uses a daemon called syslogd to automatically log events on  your com­
puter. Several variations of syslog, including [rsyslog](/obisdian_ntoes/notes_obsidian/Penetration/Data Cleanup/rsyslog.md) and syslog-ng, are used
on different distributions of Linux, and even though they operate very simi­larly, some minor differences exist.*

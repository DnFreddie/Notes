## Software Defined Networking

Networking devices have different functional panes of operation

-   Data control and management of planes of operation
    -   Split the functions into seprate logical units
        -   Extend the functionality and management of signle device
        -   Perfectly built for the cloud

### Infrastructure Layer

***Data plane***

-   Processes networking frames and packets

-   Forwarding trunking encrypting
    [NAT](/Notes/posts/Network/basic_network_connections/NAT) ###
    Control layer / Control plane

-   Manges the action of the data plane

-   Routing tables session tables NAT tables

-   Dynamic routing protocol updates ### Application layer/Management
    plane

-   Configure and mange the device

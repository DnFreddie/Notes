# Profiling 
* Use tools that perform Sampling 
## CPU text 
* taking *timed-interval* samples of the on-
CPU code paths.
    * `flame graphs`
| Flame Graph 1 | Flame Graph 2 |
|--------------|--------------|
| ![Flame Graph 1](/Notes/flame_graph_visualsiatio_.visual.png) | ![Flame Graph 2](/Notes/flame_graph_visual.png) |

Flame graphs visualize function calls and their CPU usage.
They show which functions were called, their execution order, and how much CPU time they consumed.
The wider a function block is, the more CPU time it took.
Syscalls (system calls) appear in the stack, revealing how the program interacts with the operating system.
The wider the line the more time process took on the CPU

## Tracing 
`Event Based Recording`  (*tracing dumping and snooping are basically the same*)
* `execscooop`  *looks for small programs running in the background*
    * Run mini programs on the kernel application events
    * Similar to java script running on click or on scroll on top of the main runtime 


### Static Instrumentation
*marking the functions inside the code so that later u can see how often they are used and their performance* 
### Dynamic Instrumentation
*You to insert measurement points while it's running*
Similar to debugger setting the break points...

# **Linux 60-Second Performance Analysis Checklist**
*This is a Linux tool-based checklist that can be executed in the first 60 seconds of a performance issue investigation*

| **Tool & Command**       | **Check**  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------
| `dmesg -T | tail`        | Kernel errors, including OOM (Out of Memory) events. |
| `vmstat -SM 1`           | System-wide stats: run queue length, swapping, overall CPU usage. |
| `mpstat -P ALL 1`        | Per-CPU balance: a single busy CPU may indicate poor thread scaling. |
| `pidstat 1`              | Per-process CPU usage: identify unexpected CPU consumers, user/system CPU time per process. |
| `iostat -sxz 2`          | Disk I/O stats: IOPS, throughput, average wait time, percent busy. |
| `sar -n DEV 1`           | Network device I/O: packets and throughput. |
| `sar -n TCP,ETCP 1`      | TCP statistics: connection rates, retransmits. |
| `top`                    | Check system overview: CPU, memory, and process usage. |


# Io utilization 
*Some components  might work better with the 100% utilization*
> Disks and `storage arrays`
>
> A disk that is 100% busy may also be able to accept and
> process more work, for example, by buffering writes in the on
> disk cache to be completed later.

> `Storage arrays` 
>
> frequently run at 100% utilization because some disk is busy 100% of the
> time, but the array has plenty of idle disks and can accept more work
# Cache hit or miss ration

> *The higher the better* 
> hit ratio = hits / (hits + misses)
* `Hits` The number of times a requested item is found in the cache.
* `Misses` The number of times the requested item is not in the cache and must be retrieved from a slower source.

## Hot, Cold, and Warm Caches
`Warmth` *activity that improves the `hit ratio`*

* `Cold` is empty or with unwanted  data the **`hit ratio`is 0** (*or near zero if it begins to warm up*)
* `Warm` populated with useful data but not enoughi `hit ratio`to be consider  `hot`
* `Hot` has commonly requested data and has high `hit ration`

# Operating Systems
##  Trap
*It's basically kernel managing  his little child (*user space*)*
* `SystemCalls` (*asking for help* )
    * program asks the operating system for help, like reading a file. 
* `Error&Exeption`(*making mistakes/divide-by-zero trap*)
    * when your program tries something impossible, the CPU stops it and calls the OS to handle the error. 
* `Page Fault` 
    * when your program needs memory that isâ€™t ready, the computer stops, loads the memory, and then continues.


### interrupts in general 
*It saves the state of the process , and then run an interrupt service routine
(ISR) to resolve the issue. 

#### Interrupt masking 
*Interrupt Masking = "Don't talk to me right now!"*
* Process is doing something important and can't be stopped 
* `None-Maskable interutps` (**NMI**) 
    * Basically  that bypassed process that can't be stopped 
* Linux can use an `Intelligent Platform Management
Interface (IPMI)`
    * watchdog timer that checks if the kernel
    appears to have locked up based on a lack of interrupts during
    a period of time. If so, the watchdog can issue an NMI
    interrupt to reboot the system 
    * Linux also has a software NMI watchdog for detecting lockups 


#### Hardware interrupt (*type of trap*)
*types of hardware interrupts*
* A signal sent by physical devices to the kernel (*usually to request servicing of I/O.*)

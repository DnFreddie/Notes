## Region-based memory allocator 

- **U alllcated a big chunk of memeory and every time the  more memory is requaierd u get subchanks of that **
	- At the end of the interation (*ex. Training loop*) u swipe all the memory 
- In the modern coputers u can allocate *as big memory space as  u want* since they *do not allcoate memory befor it being used*

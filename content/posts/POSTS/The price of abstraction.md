    Living in the world of the services 
Gmail  Dropbox windows  Notion they seem like a easy to 
incorporate and establish solution. 
People  are obsessed about  the liabilities 
it works it's great 
U don't have to worry about anything 
Someone else does it for u 
All u have to do is to pay the price of abstraction 

### Obvious tradoff data 

 Most of users don't go for the paid plans, which means they end up paying with their personal data instead. 
 We're talking about loads of private messages, pics of your significant other, files with all your passwords, and your deepest, darkest secrets all chilling in one place.(*check how much datat google store*)

Some people act like it's nothing
who would care about them ther are so small , but when you ask to see their phone, suddenly they're all defensive. Total double standards

And let's cut the humble act. Who says you couldn't be president one day? We're living in the age of the internet, where you can blow up overnight.

Sure, you might hear that some companies encrypt your information, which is true. But here's the kicker: they hold the keys. So, if some government agency or a shady character decides they want access, they force those companies into decrypting your data.

And even if, by some miracle, they don't have the key, they're probably storing your info somewhere else, just waiting for the day when they can crack the encryption or have enough computing power to do so.

Politicians even have special squads dedicated to digging up dirt from your past. Imagine getting hit with some embarrassing old stuff out of nowhere! It's like they've got a whole playbook for blackmailing unsuspecting people.

###  Abstraciton makes things bigger 

Ever felt like your email client is so complex  that only genius engineers at Google could tame? Millions of lines of code, churning out an astronomical amount of data, making you feel like you'll spend an eternity just trying to comprehend it.

But hold up.
Do you really need all those million features? Do you actually 
need blogger and e classrom? 


Think about it. Does your email client need to be as bloated as it is? Do you really want to wait forever for Gmail to load up every magnificent feature it has to offer?

Here's a surprise: the email client in Go has only 2500 lines of code, and it was written nine years ago. Bet you didn't see that coming, huh?

They want you to believe that complexity is the only way forward, so you don't go looking for simpler alternatives or homegrown solutions.
 
Years have passed and google still doesnt enclryp u're eamils by defult .
They could do it but who cares
U should !
### The best choice for you? Mediocrity...


We google understand precisely what our users need , regardless of the fact thath there are littelty billions of clients   out there. 
Don't diversify; stick to what we provide, because Google knows best.

While it might be comforting to tinker with your mom's Gmail account, it becomes frustrating when dealing with it or any other app daily. Your setup doesn't need to be groundbreaking, but it should be pleasant to work with.

Follow the internet's lead: copy a config file you like at first glance and tweak it. It may take a bit more time, but you'll likely never look back once you find your ultimate setup, making your work as enjoyable as possible.
### Understanding the key to abastraciotn
It's nice to execute 1000 servieces with the one line of code 
Or with one buttton 
U feel like a magiciacn 
U're casting spells and that prarrtuli whats wrong 
Information Techolgy is not magic
It's just u have some data and u won'nt it to either store it send it or manipulate it  and get some resuslt .
When u start to thinkio it this way it losses alot of glam 
But it also  quite reascharing 
It's the branch of sincec compleytyly created and desingend from people to people.
And that means taht u can undestadn it.
If u get the fundamentals and u can buidl on it to descrie other more sopicticated technologies.
U would be suprised when u get how (*thingk of somthingk clever workskk*)

It  is similar to the 
[Tress Algorithms]({{< ref "posts/Algorithms/trees_algorithms.md" >}})
but i has **one condition**
- The left  side has to **be less or eqaul** to 
- The right side has to be **greater** then node 
	- It's similar  to the [Quick sort]({{< ref "posts/Algorithms/quick_sort.md" >}})

## Voltage

-   Pressure that drives electric charges through a circuit

-   As the electric charges flow through the circuit, they encounter
    resistances, such as *wires* or other components. These
    **resistances** slow down the flow of charges

    -   The relationship between the
        [voltage_rob](/voltage_rob),
        [current_rob](/current_rob), and
        [resistance_rob](/resistance_rob) can be described
        by **Ohmâ€™s Law** which states that voltage equals current
        multiplied by resistance (*V*:*I**R*)

* The smallest **deploy-able** unit
    * Usually one app per pod
    * Group of one or more container
        * They **share storage and network** resources ([RBAC
            cluster](/CKA/RBAC_cluster))
        * Each pod gets itâ€™s own *local ip*
* **Unit of replication**
    * Easy to increase the number of pods running

## Pods kinds

### Sidecar

* Run in the same Pod as main container

* Can share folders with main container

* Can communicate via localhost

### Ambassador

* The main app does not connect to external services

    * The **ambassador container** does it
    * It works pretty much as proxy

### Adapter

* This modifies the information revived from the container to the
    desired format
    * Example logs or data required for the app

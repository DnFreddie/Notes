## payloads-options

1.  Meterpreter: A powerful and versatile payload that provides a
    full-featured command shell, file system access, and remote access
    to the target system.

2.  Reverse shell: A payload that establishes a connection from the
    target system back to the attacker’s machine, allowing the attacker
    to execute commands remotely.

3.  Command shell: A simple payload that provides a basic command shell
    on the target system, allowing the attacker to execute commands
    directly on the system.

4.  VNC injection: A payload that injects a VNC server into the target
    system, allowing the attacker to remotely view and control the
    system’s desktop.

5.  Keylogger: A payload that records keystrokes on the target system,
    allowing the attacker to capture passwords and other sensitive
    information. >\[!quote\]

## Snort 
It is widely used to detect and prevent malicious network traffic, such as malware, viruses, and other cyber threats. Snort works by monitoring network traffic in real-time and comparing it against a set of rules or signatures that define known attack patterns. When Snort detects a potential threat, it can generate alerts, block traffic, or take other actions to mitigate the attack.

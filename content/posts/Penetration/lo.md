## Loopback address

#alt-name *Local Host* This is a special software address that connects
you to your own system. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Software
and services not running on your system canâ€™t use it.</mark> You would
use lo to test something on your system, such as your own web server.

**The localhost is generally represented with the IP address 127.0.0.1**
- An easy way to self refence is to ping **127.0.0.1**

title: Go Example Based Test
---

### How Example-Based Tests Work in Go

In Go, example-based tests are written as functions with the prefix
`Example` in their names. These tests are placed in the same `_test.go`
file as your regular unit tests. They are executed by the `go test` tool
and, when correctly formatted, can be included in the documentation
generated by `go doc` or `godoc`.

#### Key Characteristics of Example-Based Tests in Go:

1.  **Automatic Validation**: If an `Example` function contains a
    `// Output:` comment, Go will automatically check that the output
    matches the expected output during testing.
2.  **Documentation Integration**: The Go documentation tools (`godoc`)
    automatically pick up example functions and display them in the
    generated documentation.
3.  **Clear and Human-Readable**: Examples provide an accessible way for
    developers to understand how to use the functions and structs.

### Writing Example-Based Tests

#### Example Structure:

1.  **Create a function named `ExampleXyz`** where `Xyz` is the function
    you want to document and test.
2.  **Provide sample code** within the function that demonstrates its
    usage.
3.  **Include an `Output` comment** that shows the expected output of
    the function. This comment serves as both a test expectation and
    documentation.

-   **Include Multiple Examples if Needed**: If your function supports
    different use cases or has edge cases, create additional example
    functions like `ExampleParseHeader_edgeCase` or
    `ExampleParseHeader_emptyHeader`.

>**Always take the names of ur'e functions inside the []!!!**

``` go
package main

type Header struct {
    Level int
    Name  string
}

func ParseHeader(s string) *Header {
    level := 0
}

// ExampleParseHeader provides an example-based test for [ParseHeader] function
func ExampleParseHeader() {
    // Sample input and parsing demonstration
    header := ParseHeader("### Example Header")
    fmt.Printf("Level: %d, Name: %q\n", header.Level, header.Name)

    // Output:
    // Level: 3, Name: "Example Header"
}
```

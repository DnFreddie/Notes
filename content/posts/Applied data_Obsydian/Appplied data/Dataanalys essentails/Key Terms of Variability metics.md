<mark class="hltr-grses">Variability itself</mark>

<mark class="hltr-szopen">measures weather the data values are tightly  clustered or spread out</mark>

*At the heart of statistic lies variability. 
Measuring it , reducing it ,distinguishing random from real variability , identifying the various source of real variability , and making key decisions in the presence of it. *

<mark class="hltr-try">Deviations</mark>
**The difference between the observed values and the estimate location**
*(errors, residuals)*

*How far/spread out  the data points are form the average*

<mark class="hltr-try">Variance</mark>
**The sum of squared deviation from the mean divided by   
(n - 1) where n is the number of data values** 

*(mean-squared-error*)

---

<mark class="hltr-try">Standard  deviation</mark>

**The square  root of the variance** 

---
<mark class="hltr-try">Mean absolute deviation </mark>

**The mean of the  absolute values of deviation form the mean** 

---
<mark class="hltr-try">Median absolute deviation </mark>


**The median of the absolute values of the deviations form the median ranges the difference between the larges and the smallest data set** 

----

<mark class="hltr-try">Order statistic </mark>
**Metrics based on the data values stored form smallest to biggest** 
*ranks*

---
<mark class="hltr-try">Percentile </mark>
**The value such that p percent of the values take on this value or less then  (100-P) percent take on this values or more** 
*quantile*

---
<mark class="hltr-try">IQR Inter quantile range </mark>
**The difference between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile**

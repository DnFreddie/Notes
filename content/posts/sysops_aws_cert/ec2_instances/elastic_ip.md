---

*If you need a fixed ip (defualt is 5 adresses)* - When reastarting the
[Ec2 instance](/Notes/posts/sysops_aws_cert/ec2_instances/ec2_instance)
changes it’s IP - It’s public as long as u don;t delete it - Atach to
one instance at a time time - You can rememap it across instances -
Don’t pay for elastic ip if attached to the server - U pay if it’s not
attached to the server

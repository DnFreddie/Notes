## Current (*I*)

-   The flow of electric charge through a conductor or circuit. *(t
    measures the speed at which electricity flows through a cable or any
    other conductor)*
    -   It represents the rate of flow of electrons or other charge
        carriers. Current is measured in amperes **(A)** and is often
        simply referred to as “amps.

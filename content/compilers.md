## Compilers

-   The binary instructions are written in machine language, an
    elementary language the [Cpu](/Linux/Kernel/Cpu) can
    understand.
-   Compilers are designed to translate the language of C code into
    machine language for a variety of *processor architectures*.

### Processor Architacture

1.  x86 architecture
2.  Sparc processor architectures (used in Sun Workstations)
3.  PowerPC processor architecture (used in pre-Intel Macs)

### Examine Binaries

Use [objdump](/objdump)

3 types of reasearch goals 
- Expolration 
- Explanationb ]
- Descriptiuon

Conceptualization 
the process  through winch we specify what we mean when we use particular terms in reaserarch 

- Theoretical framework 
- COncepts

**Independent variables**
A variable with val- uese tahat are not problematical in an analysis but are taken a simply given.
An independent variable is presumed to cause or determine a dependent variable

Criteria of measurament quality 


**Realiabity** 
- whether a particular technique applied repeatdly to the same obejct ,yields the smae results each time we use it 

**Validity**
the extant to which an empirical measure adequatly reflect the real meaning of the concept udner consideration 


**Discriminati Validity **

The extant to which an emirical measur e adequatly reflects the real meanig of the concept under consideration 



**Convengert Validity**
To what exten measures of our construcs ,that are supposed tto be realeted 



**Sampling**

- Definte a population (kinds,rocks fans)
- Smapiling Frame 
- Sampling procedure(probabiltity vs non)
- Drawing yor same 
- Daa copllection 

**Convince sampling**
Wgo is most convenient to treach 

**Snow-ball sampling**
each person interciewed may be asked to suggest additional people fo intevieving 

**Quaota sampling**
so that sample will have the same dsitribiution of featureS as aa population
